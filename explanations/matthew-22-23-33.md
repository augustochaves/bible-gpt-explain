# Explanation of Matthew 22:23-33 (Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection)

In this passage from the Gospel of Matthew, we see the Sadducees questioning Jesus about the resurrection. The Sadducees were a religious sect in ancient Judaism who did not believe in the resurrection of the dead. They were trying to trap Jesus with a hypothetical scenario involving marriage and the afterlife. However, Jesus responds to their question with wisdom and clarity, emphasizing the power of God and the reality of the resurrection.

## Verse 23-28

*"The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, saying, 'Teacher, Moses said, if a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother. So too the second and third, down to the seventh. After them all, the woman died."* - Matthew 22:23-28

- The Sadducees, who do not believe in the resurrection, come to Jesus with a question about marriage and the afterlife.
- They present a hypothetical scenario involving a woman who was married to seven brothers in succession due to the levirate marriage law.
- The scenario is designed to challenge the idea of resurrection and create confusion.

### Analysis:
- The Sadducees' question highlights their lack of belief in the resurrection and their attempt to discredit Jesus.
- Jesus' response will not only debunk their argument but also provide insights into the nature of the afterlife and the power of God.
- The levirate marriage law was a cultural practice in ancient Jewish society aimed at preserving the family lineage and inheritance.

## Verse 29-33

*"In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.' But Jesus answered them, 'You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.'"* - Matthew 22:29-33

- Jesus corrects the Sadducees' misunderstanding by explaining the nature of the resurrection and the afterlife.
- He clarifies that in the resurrection, relationships such as marriage will not exist as they do on earth.
- Jesus emphasizes the power of God and the continuity of life after death by referencing God's statement to Moses at the burning bush regarding Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

### Analysis:
- Jesus rebukes the Sadducees for their ignorance of scripture and their limited understanding of God's power.
- He teaches them that in the resurrection, earthly relationships will be transcended, and believers will be like angels in heaven.
- By referencing God's statement to Moses, Jesus underscores the reality of the resurrection and the continuity of life beyond physical death.

In conclusion, this passage from Matthew 22:23-33 provides valuable insights into the nature of the resurrection, the power of God, and the continuity of life after death. Jesus' response to the Sadducees' question not only corrects their misunderstanding but also serves as a teaching moment on the deeper spiritual truths about the afterlife. His words remind us of the reality of life beyond the grave and the transformative power of God in our lives.
