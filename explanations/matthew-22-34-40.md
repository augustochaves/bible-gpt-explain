Chapter 22:34-40 of the Gospel of Matthew talks about the Great Commandment as given by Jesus. 

*Verses 34-36*:
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"

*Verse 37*:
Jesus replied, "‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment."

*Verse 38*:
"And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.'"

*Verse 39*:
"All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."

In these verses, Jesus summarizes the entire Old Testament law into two main commandments: Love God with all your heart, soul, and mind; and love your neighbor as yourself. He emphasizes that these two commandments are the most important, and all other laws are based on these. 

This passage teaches us the importance of love in our relationship with God and others. It reminds us to prioritize our love for God above all else, and to show love and compassion towards our neighbors. Jesus' teachings on love and the Great Commandment serve as a guiding principle for Christians to follow in their daily lives.
