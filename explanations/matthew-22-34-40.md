## The Great Commandment: An Explanation
Chapter 22:34-40 of Matthew’s Gospel is a compelling and pivotal passage in the New Testament that highlights Jesus' teaching about the greatest commandments in the law. This passage, commonly known as "The Great Commandment," contains a profound exchange between Jesus and the Pharisees, particularly a lawyer among them, which essentially distills the core of Jewish ethical teachings.

### Contextual Background
Before delving into the specifics of the passage, it is essential to understand its context:
- **Setting**: This conversation takes place in Jerusalem during the final days of Jesus' ministry, just before His crucifixion.
- **Interactions**: Prior to this, Jesus had been questioned multiple times by various groups including the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians, who attempted to trap Him with tricky questions.

### Passage Breakdown and Analysis

#### The Question by the Lawyer
- **Verse 34-35**: Observing Jesus’ skillful handling of previous questions, a lawyer, an expert in Mosaic Law, asks Jesus to identify the "greatest commandment in the Law." This question wasn't just academic; it was also a test to challenge Jesus' adherence to Jewish Law.

#### Jesus’ Response: Summarizing the Law
- **Verse 37-38**: Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 6:5, a verse central to Jewish faith known as the Shema ("Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength."). He declares this the greatest and first commandment.
  - **Significance**: It emphasizes total, undivided love for God, engaging one's entire being—emotionally (heart), volitionally (soul), and vigorously (mind).

- **Verse 39**: Jesus introduces a second commandment, quoting Leviticus 19:18 ("Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself."). He places almost equal importance on this commandment.
  - **Significance**: This highlights the relational aspect of the Law, indicating that love of God is inseparable from love of others.

- **Verse 40**: By concluding that "All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments," Jesus encapsulates the entirety of Jewish moral and ceremonial law—essentially all of Scripture—into these two principles.
  - **Implications**: This statement positions love as the foundation of all biblical commands, suggesting that every law and prophetic teaching should lead to or stem from love (either towards God or towards one’s neighbor).

### Implications and Modern Application
The Great Commandment is not only foundational for understanding the essence of Christian ethical teachings but also offers several applications:
- **Priority of Love**: It establishes love as the cornerstone of human relationships and divine relationship.
- **Holistic Devotion**: The command to love God with all facets of one's being calls for a holistic approach to faith that permeates all areas of life.
- **Equality of Relationships**: By placing the love of neighbors on nearly the same level as the love of God, it elevates the significance of human dignity and mutual respect.
- **Guidance for Legal and Ethical Decisions**: Understanding that the moral and ceremonial laws are rooted in these two commandments can guide contemporary ethical decisions, ensuring they align with the overarching biblical principles of love.

### Conclusion
The Great Commandment in Matthew 22:34-40 brilliantly condenses the extensive teachings of the Law and the Prophets into two encompassing commandments centered on love. Jesus' profound summary not only underscores the interconnectedness of loving God and loving others but also challenges believers to examine the depth and authenticity of their love in both vertical (towards God) and horizontal (towards others) relationships. These verses serve as a timeless reminder of the primary call upon all who follow these teachings—to lead lives defined by deep, sacrificial love.
