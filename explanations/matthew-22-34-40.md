## Exploring Matthew 22:34-40: The Great Commandment

### Background

In Matthew 22:34-40, we encounter an intense interaction between Jesus and a group often mentioned in the Gospels, the Pharisees. These religious leaders consistently challenge Jesus to undermine His authority and teachings. The scene is set during Jesus's final week in Jerusalem, just days before His crucifixion. This moment is significant as it encapsulates the essence of Jesus's ethical teachings and His understanding of the Old Testament law.

### The Encounter and the Question

A lawyer among the Pharisees steps forward with a question intended to test Jesus. He asks, "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" This question isn’t just a query for information but is designed to trap Jesus. The law, comprising numerous commandments, was a point of intense debate among Jewish scholars. The question aimed to provoke controversy or force Jesus to prioritize one aspect of the law over others, potentially alienating Him from parts of the Jewish community.

### Jesus’s Response

Jesus’s answer, however, transcends the legalistic boundaries set by His questioners. He summarizes the entire law in two commandments, quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures. His first citation is from Deuteronomy 6:5, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." This commandment, part of the Jewish Shema, is central to Jewish confession and identity.

Jesus doesn't stop there; He adds, "And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself." This he draws from Leviticus 19:18, which in its original context, speaks about the conduct among Israelites. However, Jesus expands its application universally.

He concludes by amalgamating the entire corpus of the law and the prophets as dependent on these two commandments. This response not only skillfully avoids the trap set by the lawyer but elevates the discussion from legal obedience to the realm of relational and intentional living.

### Significance to the Reader

#### **The Essence of the Law and Prophets**

For the reader, this passage distills the vast and often complex Jewish law into manageable, relatable principles. By prioritizing love—for God and for others—Jesus reframes obedience to God as not merely a matter of following rules but as nurturing relationships.

#### **Love as the Fulfillment of the Law**

Romans 13:10 states, “Love is the fulfillment of the law." In calling his listeners to love, Jesus points out that genuine love naturally keeps all necessary laws. For instance, if one truly loves their neighbor, they wouldn't steal from them or bear false witness against them. Therefore, love is both the means and the end of the law.

#### **Universal Application**

Jesus teaches that the command to love one's neighbor extends beyond one's immediate community. The parable of the Good Samaritan, which elaborates on who one’s 'neighbor' is, illustrates that this command transcends ethnic, religious, and social barriers. Hence, these verses call for inclusivity and a universal outreach in the expression of love.

#### **Practical Application in Daily Living**

For contemporary readers, these commandments invite a daily introspection and outward demonstration of love in action. They challenge believers to consider how their relationship with God is reflected in their interactions with others. This alignment with divine and human relationships is foundational to Christian ethics and personal holiness.

### Conclusion

Matthew 22:34-40 goes beyond religious legalism and touches the heart of ethical interpersonal relationships. It challenges readers to evaluate their devotion to God and their treatment of others, underlining that the true measure of one's faith is found not in strict religious observance, but in active and sacrificial love. This teaching remains a cornerstone not only for personal faith but also for building healthy, compassionate communities.
