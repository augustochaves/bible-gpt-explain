## Explanation of Matthew 22:34-40 (The Great Commandment)

### Context

Matthew 22 is set in a tense atmosphere where Pharisees and Sadducees, the religious leaders of the time, are trying to challenge Jesus with difficult questions, hoping to discredit him or catch him saying something they could use against him. These challenges occur shortly before the celebration of Passover, during Jesus' final week in Jerusalem.

### Verses 34-40: The Great Commandment

#### **Verse 34-35: The Question**
After Jesus had silenced the Sadducees with his wisdom in the previous discussion about the resurrection, the Pharisees gathered together. One of them, an expert in the law, asked Him a question to test Him. The question was:

> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"

#### **Verse 36-40: Jesus' Response**

Instead of choosing one of the Ten Commandments directly, Jesus summarizes the entire law with two principles based on love:

1. **Love God**
    - **Verse 37**: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
    - This commandment is derived from Deuteronomy 6:5, which is part of the Shema Israel, a foundational expression of faith in Judaism.
    - It encompasses loving God completely, not just emotionally (heart), spiritually (soul), or intellectually (mind), but with every aspect of one’s being.

2. **Love Your Neighbor**
    - **Verse 39**: "And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"
    - This command reiterates what is found in Leviticus 19:18, emphasizing empathy and respect towards others as oneself.

#### **Verse 40: The Summation**
- **Verse 40**: "All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."
- Jesus elaborates that these two commands form the basis on which all the law and the prophetic teachings rest. Essentially, he posits that every rule and precept in the scripture should direct believers to act out of love, either towards God or towards their neighbors.

### Significance

- **Simplifying Complexities**: Instead of engaging in legalistic debates, Jesus simplifies the complex array of Jewish laws into two principles focused on love, reflecting that true obedience flows from genuine relationship and concern rather than mere ritual adherence.
- **Universal Application**: These commandments are accessible and applicable to everyone regardless of their depth of scripture knowledge. It captures the essence of what it means to live a moral and holy life.
- **Foundation for Christian Ethics**: This summarization by Jesus acts as the cornerstone for Christian ethical teaching. It champions a proactive attitude of love which goes beyond avoiding wrongdoing and seeks active goodwill towards others.

In essence, Matthew 22:34-40 contains Jesus’ profound declaration of what is most important in God’s eyes. It highlights a holistic, love-oriented approach to life that upholds relational and ethical priorities above legalistic specifics. This passage serves as an enduring reminder of the central role of love in the life and teachings of Christ and, subsequently, in the lives of those who follow him.
