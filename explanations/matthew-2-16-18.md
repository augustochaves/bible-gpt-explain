### Overview of Matthew 2:16-18: Herod Kills the Children

**Matthew 2:16-18** details a horrifying event in the biblical narrative known as the "Massacre of the Innocents." In these verses, King Herod, troubled by the news of the birth of Jesus, who was prophesized to someday rule as a king, executes a brutal decree to kill all male children aged two and under in Bethlehem and its surrounding districts. This event underscores Herod's desperation to maintain his political power and highlight significant themes of vulnerability, salvation, and prophecy-fulfillment that recurrently appear throughout the scripture.

### Description of the Text

- **Herod's Rage:** Out of fear that the newborn King of the Jews would one day usurp his throne, Herod resorts to a cruel and ruthless tactic. He deceitfully gathers information from the Magi (wise men from the East searching for Jesus), under the guise of wanting to worship the child but secretly plans to kill him.
  
- **The Massacre:** When his plan to use the Magi to find Jesus fails, as they are divinely warned not to return to him, Herod's fear transforms into rage. He calculates the time since the star appeared (which signaled Jesus' birth) and orders the execution of all male children two years and under in Bethlehem and the surrounding regions. This desperate act aims to eliminate any threat to his rule.

- **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** Matthew frames this tragic event as a fulfillment of Jewish prophecy, specifically referencing Jeremiah 31:15. The wailing and profound grief of mothers in Bethlehem echo the ancient sorrow of Rachel weeping for her children, symbolizing Israel's suffering.
