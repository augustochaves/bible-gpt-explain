# Explanation of Matthew 22:15-22 (Paying Taxes to Caesar)

In this passage, the Pharisees and Herodians tried to trap Jesus by asking whether it was lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not. Jesus responded with wisdom and wit, guiding his followers on the importance of both earthly and heavenly duties.

## Verses 15-17

*"Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”*

- The Pharisees and Herodians joined forces, setting aside their differences to challenge Jesus.
- By flattering Jesus and acknowledging his teachings, they tried to put him in a difficult position.

## Verses 18-21

*"But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, 'Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.’ And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, 'Whose likeness and inscription is this?’ They said, 'Caesar's.’ Then he said to them, 'Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.'”*

- Jesus saw through their intentions and called them out for their hypocrisy.
- By asking for a coin, Jesus pointed out that the currency bore Caesar's image, signifying its origin.
