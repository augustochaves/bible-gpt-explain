### Explanation of Matthew 2:13-15: The Flight to Egypt

#### Overview
Matthew 2:13-15 describes a pivotal moment in the early life of Jesus Christ where Joseph, his earthly father, is warned in a dream to flee to Egypt with Mary and the young Jesus. This event is laden with theological and prophetic significance, symbolizing both the preservation of the Savior and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.

#### Detailed Explanation
- **Verse 13:** An angel of the Lord appears to Joseph in a dream shortly after the visit from the Magi, who had come to worship Jesus. The angel's message is urgent and direct, instructing Joseph to take the child and His mother and flee to Egypt. This directive comes because King Herod intends to search for the child and kill him, reflecting Herod's deep insecurity and ruthless nature, as he views the newborn King of the Jews as a threat to his rule.

- **Verse 14:** Joseph’s response is immediate and compliant. He leaves at night, emphasizing the urgency and danger of the situation. This nocturnal escape underlines the seriousness of the divine warning and the peril faced by the young child. Joseph's obedience to the divine command plays a crucial role in the preservation of Jesus' life, adhering to a theme of divine intervention and guidance recurrent throughout Jesus' early life.

- **Verse 15:** The family remains in Egypt until Herod's death, fulfilling the prophecy "...Out of Egypt I called my son." This quote is from Hosea 11:1, initially referring to Israel's historic exodus from Egypt, but Matthew uses it here to show a deeper second fulfillment in Jesus' return from Egypt. This not only establishes Jesus as a new Moses-like figure but also as the true Israel, embodying the people of God.

#### Significance to the Reader
1. **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** This passage highlights the consistent theme of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, underlining the belief that Jesus' life was part of a divine plan set forth through Israel's history. For believers, this reaffirms the authenticity and divine nature of Jesus' mission and life. 

2. **Divine Protection and Provision:** The flight to Egypt showcases God’s active involvement in protecting His Son from earthly dangers. This act of deliverance is a powerful reminder of God's sovereignty and care, extending encouragement and assurance to readers that, like Jesus, they too are under God's protective watch.

3. **Themes of Obedience and Trust:** Joseph’s immediate action upon receiving the divine message stresses the virtues of obedience and trust in divine guidance. This narrative invites readers to reflect on their own responsiveness to God’s guidance, encouraging a life of faithful and immediate responses to God’s directions.

4. **Jesus and Israel:** By drawing parallels between Israel's history and Jesus’ life, this passage enriches the understanding of Jesus as the embodiment of true Israel. It deepens the theological implications of Jesus' actions and teachings, viewing them as not just reformative but also restorative to the ideals upon which Israel was founded.

#### Conclusion
The Flight to Egypt is more than a historical recount; it is a profound theological statement about Jesus' role as the Messiah, the ongoing divine interaction in the world, and the fulfillment of God’s promises. It reassures the reader of the reliability of God’s word and His overarching plan of salvation, which is steadfast and interwoven through the lives of individuals and the course of history. This passage encourages trust and obedience in the face of divine instructions, emphasizing that such qualities are essential for those who seek to fulfil the purposes laid out for them by God.
