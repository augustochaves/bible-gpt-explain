## Overview of Matthew 2:19-23 (The Return to Nazareth)

### Summary
In Matthew 2:19-23, an angel appears to Joseph in a dream for the third time, instructing him to return to Israel with Mary and Jesus because those who sought the child's life are dead. Upon hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, Joseph, guided by God’s warning in a dream, decides to live in the district of Galilee, in a town called Nazareth. This passage concludes the nativity narrative and subtly sets the stage for Jesus’s public ministry later narrated in the Gospel.

### Detailed Explanation
This passage opens with Joseph, once again receiving divine guidance through a dream. Here, the angel informs him that it's safe to return to Israel because the rulers who sought to kill Jesus are deceased. The narrative then points out Joseph's cautious approach thereafter: upon learning that Archelaus was ruling Judea, and aware of Archelaus' notorious tyrannical traits (similar to his father Herod), Joseph avoids Judea. 

His continuous responsiveness to divine warnings and commands showcases Joseph’s faith and his significant role as a protector of Mary and Jesus. The family instead relocates to Nazareth, a town in the northern region of Galilee—a move that shapes the future identification of Jesus as "Jesus of Nazareth."

The choice of Nazareth as the family’s home carries deep prophetic fulfillment. The text notes that "He shall be called a Nazarene," which is not a direct quotation from the Old Testament but a thematic reflection of the prophecies describing the Messiah as a humble, and perhaps even unrecognized figure (also hinted at in Isaiah’s prophecies and by the judges of Israel occasionally being described as ‘Nazirites’ or consecrated ones).

### Significance to the Reader
The passage of Matthew 2:19-23 is significant to readers for several reasons:

1. **Divine Guidance and Protection**:
   For those of faith, this passage reaffirms the theme that God guides and protects his followers. Just as Joseph is guided through dreams, the faithful are reminded that divine support is ever-present, subtly guiding and protecting them through the vicissitudes of life.

2. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**:
   This section underscores Matthew's theme of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. The return to Nazareth and the title 'Nazarene' tie into broader messianic expectations and predictions, reinforcing the belief in Jesus as the planned and promised Savior.

3. **The Importance of Obedience**:
   Joseph’s obedience to divine messages, despite possible personal misgivings or fears, is a model of faithful obedience. His actions reflect a proactive and protective form of faith—moving, adapting, and making hard decisions based on divine lead. This is a poignant reminder of the blessings and protection that follow when one chooses faith-driven action over passive belief.

4. **Preparation for Ministry**:
   Lastly, Nazareth is relatively obscure and of no significant political or religious influence in comparison to Jerusalem. By growing up in Nazareth, Jesus embodies a grass-roots aspect of ministry, coming from a place of humility and ordinariness, which is crucial in his mission to reach the common man and not just the elite. His ministry draws strength from proximity to ordinary human experiences, thus making his teachings more relatable and grounded.

Hence, Matthew 2:19-23 not only circles back to the themes of protection, prophecy, and providence but also sets a foundation for understanding the nature and approach of Jesus's later works. The passage encourages readers to notice the interweaving of the ordinary with divine purpose, inviting them to reflect on the presence and influence of divine guidance in their own lives.
